# Building-LLMS-From-scratch

# Building a Large Language Model (LLM) from Scratch
This project demonstrates how to design, train, and deploy a Large Language Model (LLM) from the ground up. It walks through the core concepts and practical steps behind modern language models like GPT, with a focus on understanding the architecture, tokenization, data processing, and training workflows required to build a functional LLM.

Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, this project aims to demystify the inner workings of LLMs and provide a hands-on guide to constructing your own model.
